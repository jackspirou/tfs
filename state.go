// ResourceState holds the state of a resource that is used so that
// a provider can find and manage an existing resource as well as for
// storing attributes that are used to populate variables of child
// resources.
//
// Attributes has attributes about the created resource that are
// queryable in interpolation: "${type.id.attr}"
//
// Extra is just extra data that a provider can return that we store
// for later, but is not exposed in any way to the user.
//
type ResourceState struct {
	// This is filled in and managed by Terraform, and is the resource

	// Dependencies are a list of things that this resource relies on
	// existing to remain intact. For example: an AWS instance might
	// depend on a subnet (which itself might depend on a VPC, and so
	// on).
	//
	// Terraform uses this information to build valid destruction
	// orders and to warn the user if they're destroying a resource that
	// another resource depends on.
	//
	// Things can be put into this list that may not be managed by
	// Terraform. If Terraform doesn't find a matching ID in the
	// overall state, then it assumes it isn't managed and doesn't
	// worry about it.

	// have been created but are in a bad or unknown state and

	// be created by Apply. If the replacement Primary creates successfully, the
	// Deposed instance is cleaned up. If there were problems creating the
	// replacement, the instance remains in the Deposed list so it can be
	// destroyed in a future run. Functionally, Deposed instances are very
	// similar to Tainted instances in that Terraform is only tracking them in
	// order to remember to destroy them.
